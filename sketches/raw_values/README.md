This sketch is used for the IMUduino to stream the raw data from the device over
BTLE.

Packets are in the form:

| 1           | 2 ... n                | n + 1        |
|:-----------:|:----------------------:|:------------:|
| packet type | data (see packet type) | xor checksum |

Data is dependent on the packet type.  Integers are stores as 2-byte words with the
low byte first, and the high byte second

## Checksum

The checksum is generated by xoring all the values in the packet (except the checksum).
It's basic, but probably good enough.  More testing is needed to know for sure.

## Packet Types

### Position Data

packet length = 20 bytes

packet type byte = 'P'

data:

* acceleration x *int16*
* acceleration y *int16*
* acceleration z *int16*
* gyroscope x *int16*
* gyroscope y *int16*
* gyroscope z *int16*
* magnometer x *int16*
* magnometer y *int16*
* magnometer z *int16*

### Atmosphere Data

packet length = 6 bytes

packet type byte = 'A'

data:

* temperature *int16*
* pressure *int16*
